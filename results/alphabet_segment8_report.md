# Segment8 alphabet benchmark

This report records the reproducible Jev run for the LED/dot-matrix `segment8` renderer.

## Run

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test*.py' -v
python alphabet_benchmark.py --style segment8 --variants-per-letter 5 --output results/alphabet_segment8_5x.csv
```

- Input: synthetic uppercase A-Z glyphs rendered from an 8x8 binary matrix and expanded to a strict 32x32 `#`/`.` grid.
- Backend: Jev SystemOne.
- Samples: 26 letters x 5 variants = 130 calls.
- Valid calls: 130.
- API errors: 0.
- Correct: 22.
- Accuracy: 16.92%.
- Random baseline: 3.85%.
- Mean latency: 513 ms.
- 95% Wilson interval: 11.45% to 24.30%.

## Comparison

The earlier Pillow-font run on the same 130-call design scored 11/130 (8.46%). The `segment8` run scored 22/130 (16.92%), an improvement of 8.46 percentage points.

Per-letter accuracy was strongest for H, L, and T (5/5 each), followed by A and K (3/5 each), and D (1/5). Many diagonal or curved letters remained difficult for Jev.

The raw CSV and JSON summary remain local and gitignored; this report is the tracked, non-secret result artifact.
